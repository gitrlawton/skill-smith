    "# Career Compass: AI-Powered Career Gap Analyzer with GenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case / Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Many students and professionals—especially those considering a career shift—struggle to understand how to bridge the gap between their current experience and a desired role. Traditional career guidance tools offer broad suggestions without understanding the user's background or intended direction. As a result, users often waste time applying to misaligned roles or studying irrelevant material.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How GenAI Solves the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "Career Compass empowers users to input their current resume and specify a target role and sector they want to pursue. Generative AI analyzes their current experience to identify transferable skills (with supporting evidence), highlights gaps that need to be filled, and outputs a structured roadmap including learning resources, relevant certifications, and intermediate job titles along the way. This makes career transition more actionable, personalized, and strategic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GenAI Capabilities Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Document Understanding**: Ingests and parses resumes to extract meaningful experience and skills.\n",
    "* **Few-Shot Prompting**: Leverages example-driven prompts to improve learning resource recommendations.\n",
    "* **Structured Output**: Outputs the career plan and search results in a machine-readable format for downstream display or visualization.\n",
    "* **Grounding**: Uses Google Search to retrieve relevant certification programs, online courses, and other learning content tailored to the gap."
