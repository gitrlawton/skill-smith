    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a Generative AI application that converts resume or LinkedIn profile data into a personalized roadmap for career transition. It identifies potential new roles, skill gaps, and curated resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case**: Personalized career guidance for students and professionals transitioning between industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GenAI Capabilities Used**:\n",
    "- Document Understanding\n",
    "- Few-shot Prompting\n",
    "- Structured Output (JSON format)\n",
    "- Grounding (Google Search)\n",
    "\n",
    "📂 **Before You Run This Notebook:**\n",
    "By default, to use this notebook you must upload your resume as a PDF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click **Add Data** > **Upload** on the right-hand sidebar.\n",
    "2. Select your resume file and ensure it is named `my_resume.pdf`.\n",
    "3. The uploaded file will be stored in `/kaggle/input/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔄 **Alternatively**: If you prefer not to upload a resume, you can comment out the PDF cell (Cell 5) and uncomment the LinkedIn cell (Cell 6), then paste in the public URL to your LinkedIn profile. Note that many LinkedIn pages require authentication and may not always load successfully in this environment."
